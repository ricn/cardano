# Cardano

The library is still in early development. Consider it experimental and the API might change in the future.

This library is the implementation of [the idea](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Elixir-library/350635-48088) submitted to Catalyst project.

## Prerequisites

1. You need to have the [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) up and running

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cardano` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cardano, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/cardano](https://hexdocs.pm/cardano).
